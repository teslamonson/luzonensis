ABSTRACT
Introduction
Recent fossil discoveries have emphasized the diversification of brain and body size in Plio-Pleistocene fossil hominids. Homo floresiensis has been described as having brain and body size smaller than any living humans, and the Homo luzonensis dentition suggest that this taxon was also diminutive. However, to date, there has been no way to estimate endocranial volume or body mass from the H. luzonensis fossil materials, which are largely comprised of teeth.

Methods 
We assessed the phenotypic relationship between relative third molar length, endocranial volume, and body mass using a published phylogeny, brain and body size data, and maxillary and mandibular postcanine dental metrics for n=16 hominid taxa. 

Results
Maxillary and mandibular relative third molar lengths are significantly correlated with endocranial volume and body mass in Plio-Pleistocene hominids, but Homo floresiensis deviates from this scaling relationship. Using this significant allometric relationship, we estimated endocranial volume and body mass for Homo luzonensis. 

Discussion
Geologically older hominid taxa tend to have relatively longer third molars and smaller endocranial volumes. We discuss the effects of growth rates on the dentition and explore the hypothesis that H. luzonensis represents a short-statured population that evolved via insular island nanism and postnatal growth restriction.
